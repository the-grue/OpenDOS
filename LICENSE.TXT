(30) days after the date (a) of shipment to you of the repaired or 
replaced Software, or (b) Caldera advised you how to operate the
Software so as to achieve the functionality described in the 
Documentation. Only if you inform Caldera in writing of your problem 
with the Software during the applicable warranty period and provide
evidence of the date you purchased a license to the Software will 
Caldera be obligated to honor this warranty. Caldera will use reasonable 
commercial efforts to repair, replace, advise or, for individual 
consumers, refund pursuant to the foregoing warranty within 30 days 
of being so notified.

Agreement, then this warranty shall immediately be terminated. This 
warranty shall not apply if the Software is used on or in conjunction
