New or changed commands:

In Config.sys:

 HIFILES/HIFCBS	moves file handles and file control blocks (FCBs) to upper or
		high memory if available
 HISTACKS	moves interrupt stacks to upper or high memory
 HILASTDRIVE	moves drive table to upper or high memory
 DDSCS=UMB|HIGH|HIGH,UMB
		moves drive descriptor tables (DDSCS) to upper or high memory;
		default is DDSC=LOW
 DOSDATA=UMB	moves main DOS data segment to upper memory; default is LOW
 XBDA=LOW|UMB|LOW,UMB
		relocates extended BIOS data area (XBDA) to low base or upper
		memory if the memory manager has not already done this
 VERSION=x.xx[,y.yy]
		sets the DOS version (Int 21h/AH=30h) and optionally the true
		DOS version (Int 21h/AX=3306h) to be reported to programs
 [HI]INSTALLLAST
		works like INSTALL/HIINSTALL, but loads program after the DOS
		data segment relocation
 COLOUR fg,bg,bd
		changes the foreground, background and border colour of the
		DOS screen

 [HI]BUFFERS	can now also use upper memory if available
 FILES/FCBS	uses upper memory by default if available
 LASTDRIVE	uses upper memory by default if available
 HISTORY	uses upper memory by default if available

In batch files/on the command line:

 COLOUR [fg][,[bg][,[bd]]]|ON|OFF
		changes the foreground, background and border colour of the
		DOS screen

 TIME /T	display current time without prompting for new one
 DATE /T	display current date without prompting for new one
 DIR /B		lists filenames without any other info

New or changed system calls:

 Int 21h/AX=7302h	Get Extended Drive Parameter Block
	/AX=7303h	Get Extended Free Disk Space
	/AX=7305h	alternative Absolute Disk Read/Write Interface
	/AX=3001h	Get Version Flag

	/AX=7142h	Long LSEEK
			This function works like 42h but uses a 64bit (QWORD)
			buffer pointed to by DS:DX for both the signed offset
			and the resulting absolute file pointer position; the
			type of movement is read from CL
	/AX=71A6h	Get File Info
	/AX=71A7h,BL=01	Convert DOS Time to Windows 64bit Time
	/AX=714E/714Fh	LFN FindFirst/Next
	/AX=71A1h	LFN FindClose
	/AX=7143h,
	 BL=3/4		LFN Set/Get Last Write Time

 Int 21h/AX=440dh	(Generic IOCTL) now supports category code 48h (FAT32)
			stubs have been added for sub functions 4ah, 4bh, 6ah
			and 6bh	(lock/unlock logical/physical drive) that fake
			successful operation
	/AH=1fh/32h	(Get DPB) ***no longer returns DPBs for FAT32 drives***
			reverted to previous behaviour
	/AH=30h		(Get DOS Version) now reports OEM code eeh (DR DOS)
			instead of 00h (PC DOS)
	/AX=3306h	(Get True DOS Version) now returns 7.01 instead of
			6.00, configurable by SETVER or VERSION command
	/AH=36h		(Get Free Disk Space) no longer reports cluster sizes
			>32K on FAT32 partitions
	/AH=49h		(Free Memory) merges adjacent free blocks after freeing
	/AH=53h		(Translate BPB to DDSC) now uses FAT32 BPBs and DDSCs
			if CX=4558h and DX=4152h
