  become larger than the FAT+ limit (256 GB - 1)
- changed function 4E/4Fh (Find First/Next) to report a maximum file size of
  4 GB - 1
(20.8.2006):
- fixed bug in new function 7142h that caused the seek direction parameter to
  be lost
- fixed bug that caused the carry flag to be cleared when an unsupported sub
  function of DOS function 71/73h was called, causing some LFN-aware programs
  to assume that the LFN API was present
- fixed another bug in function 7142h that caused register DS not to be
  restored
- fixed yet another bug in function 7142h that caused positioning relative to
  the end of the file to change the file size instead of the file pointer
- fixed bug in free disk space computation routine that caused the next drive
  letter to become inaccessible until reboot
- added functions int 21h/AX=71A6 (Get File Info) and 21h/AX=71A7,BL=01

  previous address if it had been relocated with the XBDA command
(17.6.2007):
- fixed FAT size for FAT32 in BIOS Parameter Block reported by IOCTL

  drive to reset the free disk space info for that drive to the value
  previously present in the FS Info Sector before the allocation of the cluster
  chain

  determined, this will (hopefully) fix reported problems with some boot
  managers and non-standard MBRs

  drives and for files with no access rights set to prevent hidden files
  created or modified by DOSLFN from being mistaken for password-protected
- restructured function 7142h (Long Lseek) to make it check the subfunction
  number before the file handle
- inverted error codes in function 73h since this is how error_exit expects
  them

  caused them to silently fail when called with an invalid file handle
- changed network redirector to check whether a path that both resembles an UNC
  (networking) filename AND contains a drive letter is on a local drive before
  assuming that it is remote
- removed unnecessary restriction regarding multiple leading path separators in
  function 3Dh (Open) since it did not apply to other occurrences
(21.07.2011):

  structure
- implemented function 7302h (Get Extended DPB)
- added alternate implementation of the int 25h/26h absolute disk read/write
  interface via function 7305h, for the few silly programs that try to use the
  so-called "extended" interface without checking if it is present
- changed the behaviour of functions 1Fh and 32h (Get DPB) to return error code
  FFh (invalid drive) for FAT32 drives; again, this was needed because some
  programs rely on this function to identify FAT32 drives
- changed OEM version code in function 30h from 00h (PC DOS) to EEH (DR DOS),
  changed true version as reported by function 3306h to 7.01, let SetVer

  the reason why the taskswitcher refused to start
- fixed bugs in command.com to make comparisons in batch files with quoted
  strings work as expected

  freeing a memory block
- fixed an overflow error that prevented DR-DOS from reading/writing files if
  the seek position was larger than (partition_size modulo 4 GB)

  command line
- added new experimental config.sys command VERSION=x.x to allow to change the
  global version setting
- added support for block device drivers that are loaded with INSTALL in

  upper memory if for some reason the memory manager fails to do this, added
  new config.sys command XBDA=LOW,UMB
- fixed a bug in the FAT32 FSInfo block handling routines that manifested after
  the DDSC relocation feature had been introduced
- fixed age-old OpenDOS bug that caused wrong value to be used for code segment
  padding which made DR-DOS hang during boot when loaded low on some machines
- made command.com ignore leading semicolons in %PATH% environment variable
- changed location of static arrays in command.com to another segment to work
  around what seems to be a bug in TaskMgr
- changed boot code so that DR-DOS will look for ibmdos.com and config.sys on
  the correct drive when booting from a second primary partition
- changed history and deblock buffer setup routines to use upper mem for these
  buffers if available
- changed FILES/FCBS to use upper memory by default if available

  load programs after the DOSDATA segment relocation to work around problems
  with older programs that are incompatible with this feature when INSTALLed
