This is a work-in-progress version of the forthcoming v7.01.08 release of my
DR-DOS Enhancement Patch. It is to be considered unstable and not ready for
general use other than for demonstrating the progress that was made since the
last regular release. If you want a stable version, either use the previous
version (v7.01.07) or wait for the regular v7.01.08 release.
