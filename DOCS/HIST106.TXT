7.01.06:
- added support for FAT32 partition types and boot records to disk device
  driver
- expanded sector numbers in buffer management routines from 24 to 32 bit to
  allow partitions larger than 8 GB
- added FAT32 specific entries to DR-DOS file system structures
- rewrote most file system routines to cope with 32-bit cluster numbers and
  dynamic root directories (FAT32)
- added support for FAT32 file system info block to store free disk space
  to speed up disk access
- changed the free disk space routine to use dynamic cluster sizes on FAT32
  partitions to report free space more accurately
- added a routine to command.com to display large numbers with thousands
  delimiters, changed dir command to use it
- fixed bugs in the boot routine to allow booting from 64 KB cluster
  partitions
- fixed bug that caused command.com not to terminate the PSP chain at the
  master PSP, leading to all kinds of problems with the environment space
- fixed bug in dir command that caused the free disk space on partitions with
  64 KB clusters to be displayed as zero
- fixed bug in the memory allocation routine that would cause the install
  command to crash sometimes when upper memory was present
- fixed bug in LBA routines that caused writing problems on some systems, this
  may also speed up writing on other systems
- increased heap space in command.com to prevent corruption of command line
  arguments while processing deeply nested batch files
- fixed bug that sometimes caused XMSDSK to corrupt the last memory block

7.01.05:
- some preliminary changes for 32-bit file system support
- added support for 4 GB FAT16 partitions (64 KB cluster size)

7.01.04:
- added routines to convert LBA values to CHS and vice versa
- rewrote the partition registering routine to use the LBA values in the
  partition tables instead of the obsolete CHS values, disabled old code
- added int 13 extensions (LBA) support to the partition login and track r/w
  routines
- added support for partition type 0eh (FAT16B LBA)

7.01.03:
- added a hex value output routine for debugging purposes
- changed the behavior of the partition registering routine to not follow loops
  in the partition tables

7.01.02:
- changed some text strings to reflect the new version number
- slightly changed the structure of the start-up message routine
- added support for ExtendedX (type 0fh) partitions
- added a routine that checks for and displays the version number of extended
  int 13 (LBA) support
- some preliminary changes for LBA support

7.01.01 (original release):
- fixed the compilation to work with MASM 6.0b and Watcom C/C++ 10.0a
- no user-visible changes
