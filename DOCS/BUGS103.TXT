There is currently one known bug in the DR-DOS kernel which apparently plagues
all versions from 7.01 to 7.03. This bug prevents DR-DOS from booting if there
are very large FAT32 partitions on any hard disks in the system; it will simply
hang. I do not know what causes this problem, but I will probably fix it in one
of the next patches. Until then, as a work-around, use DR-DOS 7.03 and set the
type of any extended partitions that point to these FAT32 partitions to 0fh.
Since DR-DOS 7.03 does not recognize this type at boot time, it will simply not
register these partitions. This will not affect the DRFAT32 driver, so you can
still work with your FAT32 partitions normally.

Update: This bug seems to be caused by loops in the partition tables, i.e.
extended partition records pointing to the same or a lower cylinder number.
I have included a work-around in v7.01.03 which should fix this. This should
also solve the problem of FAT16 partitions beyond the 7.8 GB barrier being
registered without LBA support.
